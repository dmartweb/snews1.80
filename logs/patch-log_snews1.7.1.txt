Version Protocol
-----------------
1) All versions in the 1.7 series will only include patches and fixes
   to correct bugs or improve performance.
   Modifications affecting system functionality will not be added.

2) When one patch (or two) is added, the version remains the same.

3) When several patches are added at once, the version will be sub-numbered.
   Example: from 1.7.1 to 1.7.2 or 1.7.2 to 1.7.3.

4) If improvements to system functionality are required,  the  version
   will change to 1.8.0. Minor patches and fixes added to that version
   will be sub-numbered as 1.8.1, 1.8.2, and so on.
